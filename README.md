## 🛡️ Cyber Defence Frameworks

Discover frameworks and policies that help establish a good security posture. Learn how organisations use these in defensive strategies.

It is vital to understand the stages of an attack and the techniques an adversary employs. Understanding the steps taken during an incident helps create an appropriate response and investigate why and how the incident occurred. Applying policies, frameworks and models, such as the Cyber Kill Chain model, can improve an organisation's defensive posture.

### 🧠 Overview

### 👨‍💻 Junior Security Analyst Intro  
- Learned what a Junior Security Analyst does day to day, including alert triage, using security tools, and escalating incidents.  
- Explored real SOC tasks like reviewing suspicious IPs, spotting attacker behaviour, and blocking threats.

### 🧱 Pyramid Of Pain   
- Learned how each tier of the Pyramid of Pain represents a different level of difficulty for attackers to change, from simple hash values to complex TTPs.  
- Gained insight into why targeting behaviours and tools, rather than just IOCs, is a more effective strategy for defenders.

### 🔗 Cyber Kill Chain  
- Learned how to break down a cyber attack into distinct stages using the Cyber Kill Chain model, from reconnaissance to actions on objectives.  
- Explored how attackers operate at each step and how defenders can detect, delay, or stop them using real-world examples and hands-on labs.
